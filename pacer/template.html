    <p>If you are seeking Federal criminal case listings for mundane reasons, the PACER report is below.  If you are on the trail 
        of the sealed indictment count anomaly, Q, and / or you want to take the red pill and find out "how deep the rabbit hole goes," 
        see <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/21/12/Q.html'>my latest sealed indictment thoughts</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The report below is from <a href='https://pacer.uscourts.gov/'>PACER</a>, the US Federal Court online docket.  From late 2017, 
        there may or may not be an anomaly in how many sealed criminal action have been filed.  (In the reports, such as below, sealed cases are 
        below 
        the non-sealed cases.)  I discuss the numbers, link to more reports, consider the implications, and mention how to get a PACER account 
        on <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/8/02/pacer/pacer.html'>my main sealed indictment 
            page</a>.</p>
    <p>The only changes I've made to the report itself are to remove my login and user IDs.  In this version, I have removed styling, 
        PACER menus, etc.  
        I link to the rawest form of the report that I saved: <a id='Kwynn_rawurl' href=''>Back to this page for now; loading raw link...</a>.
