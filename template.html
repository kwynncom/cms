        <p>The report below is from <a href='https://pacer.uscourts.gov/'>PACER</a>, the US Federal Court online docket.  Sealed criminal cases (indictments) 
            have been filed at 65 times the normal rate from October, 2017 through September, 2020, and will likely continue at that same pace.  Over 200,000 
            sealed cases have been filed over that period.  In the reports, sealed cases are below the non-sealed cases.  
        </p>
        <p>I discuss the numbers, link to more reports, consider the implications, and mention how to get a PACER account on <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/8/02/pacer/pacer.html'>my main sealed indictment 
                page</a>.</p>
        <p>The only changes I've made to the report itself are to remove my login and user IDs.  In this version, I have removed styling, PACER menus, etc.  
            If you're using JavaScript--generally equivalent to being human / not-a-bot--I link to the rawest form of the report that I saved: <a id='Kwynn_rawurl' href=''>Back to this page for now; loading raw link...</a>.
