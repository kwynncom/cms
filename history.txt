arch_2021_12 is where I tried an iframe instead of changing the PACER html.  The problem is that some JavaScript within Pacer is rewriting the URL.  I could

I will likely delete quite a few files and directories.

solve_tmp has an .htaccess that solves when I created pacer_tmp
v001 is very old
    This looks like the actual CMS in terms of an online way to edit pages.  
htaccess is very old
t is from today when I was modeling kwynn.com's structure
html_php_compare is useful to see ETag and Date-Modified differences, but I've seen them now.
